## Discussion items (35 min)
* How can we narrow down user stories to make them easier to complete
   * Can we make the GUI simpler?
   * Can we somehow make things simpler/easier?
* What colors should be used for what?
   * What background color should the app have?
   * What colors should the menu buttons have?
* How are the presenters going to access the model?


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
Outcomes:
* How we should handle the user stories
   * We want to make the user stories easier, the group decided that an “Acceptable user experience” will suffice. Don’t end up sinking time into features that, for example, look good/impressive, but take a disproportionately high amount of time to complete. In other words, if there is a passable, easy way to solve something (GUI-wise), use that solution initially.
   * The stats and achievements should be kept at a basic level, it should not contain things that are not easy accessible. There should not be too many achievements.
   * * The colors should be:
   * The background should be a light grey color, this color will be defined in the Color.xml file
   * The colors of the menu buttons should be white for the moment, this might be changed at a later time if we are not satisfied with the looks.
* It should use the singleton item which should be parsed from the stored state at app start.


Assignments: 
* Remaining things to be done for user story #7 (Thomas, Mathias):
   * Click card to edit corresponding Note
   * Long press card to delete Note
   * Refresh view of cards when finishing editing/adding cards.
* Write in the SDD today between 16:00 and 17:00 (Everyone).
* Finish user story #11 (Gustav)
* Create a user story for quiz mode (Everyone)
* Implement quiz mode (Victor, Alexander)
